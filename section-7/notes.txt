where do images get physically stored?
How do images *get* to the place they should be stored?
How do we relate images to a particular blog post?

solution 1: In MongoDB but this is bad because it is too expensive
soluition 2: In HD Attached to Server but this doesn't work with horizonal scalling
Solution 3: Outside Data Store: Amazon S3, Azure File Storage, Google Cloud Storage

even if the uploaded file ends up with image extension
a user can still take an executable file and change the file extension
but we should at least check the file extension and check if it is of image type

using express server as a temp storage costs a lot of cpu

<input type="file" accept="image/*" />

create amazon s3 bucket
after that generate a set of user credentials to get access to that bucket

go to iam
generate a policy
    service:
        s3
        All S3 actions (s3:*)
    resource:
        bucket: Add ARN and add the bucket name
        object: add the bucket name and for object name click any
review policy

generate a user
    username: s3-blog-bucket
    Select AWS access type: Programmatic access

    attach existing policy

npm i aws-sdk

search for aws javascript sdk
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/v3/latest/index.html
aws sdk for javascript s3
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/S3.html
go to getsignedurl

putObject is what we refer to for the operation to upload a new file to amazon s3 bucket

key property is the name of the file that we are going to upload


go to bucket permissions
cors
I added this but we can put more restriction, video 163
