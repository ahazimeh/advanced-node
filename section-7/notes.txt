where do images get physically stored?
How do images *get* to the place they should be stored?
How do we relate images to a particular blog post?

solution 1: In MongoDB but this is bad because it is too expensive
soluition 2: In HD Attached to Server but this doesn't work with horizonal scalling
Solution 3: Outside Data Store: Amazon S3, Azure File Storage, Google Cloud Storage

even if the uploaded file ends up with image extension
a user can still take an executable file and change the file extension
but we should at least check the file extension and check if it is of image type

using express server as a temp storage costs a lot of cpu
